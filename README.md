# Deep-Learning-Week-5-GANs
GANs.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook and the best to visualize for peer grading. GANs Week 5 Report is in pdf format for those that prefer this over a Jupyter notebook (download for higher quality visualization). To run, all files need to be included in the relevant folders, all libraries need to be installed, and the Kaggle dataset (not included) needs to be downloaded. The bulk of the code is via Python scripts and are included as dataset.py, infer.py, models.py, train.py, and utils.py and are placed with the /src folder.  Most generated files such as images.zip, etc. are not included but can be acquired by running all the code.
